# OnlyFans-like Chat Features

This plugin introduces basic scaffolding to add monetization features to a chat application within WordPress. It creates a database table for managing user subscriptions and registers a private post type for exclusive messages. The plugin is a starting point for building functionality such as subscription tiers, pay-per-message, and tipping.
